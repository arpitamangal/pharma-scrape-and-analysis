Small quantities are also produced in females. As drugs, male sex hormones are given to compensate for hormonal deficiency in hypopituitarism or disorders of the testes. They may be used to treat breast cancer in women, but either synthetic derivatives called anabolic steroids, which have less marked side- effects, or specific anti-estrogens are often preferred. Anabolic steroids also have a ""body building"" effect that has led to their (usually nonsanctioned) use in competitive sports, for both men and women.",
Sleeping Drugs,"The two main groups of drugs that are used to induce sleep are benzodiazepines and barbiturates.
